# weather_app
My First API Project!

In this project I'm going to be creating an app that utilizes API to return realtime weather data from weatherapi.com. The user will be able to input their location and the app will fetch the corresponding data from their location and display that data to them.

All done. This project was pretty easy and not very time-consuming in the sense that I didn't really add many cool features to it. I styled this in probably 10 minutes and did the project in like.. an hour of actually working. Adding extra features to this just seems like busy work that I know I can do, like a toggle button for Celsius and Fahrenheit or the next 3 days or just whatever. What matters is that I learned how to utilize an API, create an object using it's returned json values and a factory. I also was SOO much more neat and tidy with this which probably contributed to the speed due to much less repeated code. Let's move on and continue learning!
